Word Prediction Application
========================================================

This is a prototype [Shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io/) application required by the capstone project of the [Johns Hopkins University's Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project).

The application takes a phrase as input and outputs a prediction of the next word using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning language model trained from a large corpora of English texts from Blogs, News and Twitter available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip).


The NLP machine learning language model

The NLP machine learning language model was developed using the 
Besides this software infrastructure, portions of R code were based on researching these references:
